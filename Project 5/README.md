# Conway's Game of Life

**Conway's Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician **John Horton Conway** in 1970. It is a zero-player game, where the state of the grid evolves based on initial conditions, and the game runs automatically without any further input. The game is made up of a grid of cells that can be either **alive** or **dead**, and it evolves based on a set of rules.

## Rules of Conway's Game of Life

1. **Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.** (Underpopulation)
2. **Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.** (Stable state)
3. **Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.** (Overpopulation)
4. **Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.** (Reproduction)

### How to Play:
- Click on the cells to toggle between alive (filled) and dead (empty).
- Press **spacebar** to advance to the next generation and watch the evolution of the grid.
