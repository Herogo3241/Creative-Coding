# Wave Simulation with Perlin Noise

This project demonstrates a 2D wave simulation using Perlin noise to generate smooth and realistic sea waves. The simulation uses **SDL2** for rendering and **C++** for the wave logic. The wave heights are dynamically generated based on Perlin noise, providing a smooth, animated effect that resembles ocean waves.
